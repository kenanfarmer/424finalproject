\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This project uses a dataset posted on Kaggle~\cite{kaggleComp} to detect duplicate questions on Quora, a popular question-and-answer website~\cite{quora}. The training data included \_\_\_\_ question pairs, classified as duplicates or not. The testing set was \_\_\_\_ unlabeled pairs. We used \_\_features\_\_ to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and \_\_methods\_\_ to classify duplicates. The best was \_\_\_\_.

\section{Introduction}

Quora is a website that strives to connect people from different backgrounds to be able to answer questions whose answers are "either locked in peopleâ€™s heads, or only accessible to select groups" \cite{quora}. Once these questions are answered, any other person should be able to find the responses. However, sometimes people are unable to find the questions they want and end up asking the same question again. This counteracts Quora's vision of having "only one version of each question\dots [not] a left wing version, a right wing version, a western version, and an eastern version"~\cite{quora}. 

Quora currently identifies duplicate questions with a Random Forest model~\cite{kaggleComp}. Quora does not have a method for users to mark questions as duplicates, although they allow users to redirect questions. Stack Exchange, a similar question-answer website, does allow users to mark questions as duplicates~\cite{stackdup}.
